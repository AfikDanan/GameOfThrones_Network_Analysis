# Game of Thrones Network Analysis

This repository explores the social network of characters from *Game of Thrones* (books 1-5) using graph theory and network analysis. Discover key influencers, interaction dynamics, and the structure of this fascinating fictional world.

## Features

- **Graph Construction**: Build and visualize the character interaction network across books 1-5.
- **Centrality Metrics**: Identify influential characters using degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality.
- **Closeness Analysis**: Measure how efficiently characters connect to the overall network.
- **Degree Analysis**: Evaluate the popularity of characters based on their connections.
- **Visualizations**: Generate clear and engaging visual representations of the network.
- **Comparative Insights**: Examine changes in character influence throughout the series.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: The core programming language used.
- **NetworkX**: For graph analysis and metrics computation.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating interactive and static visualizations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GameOfThrones_Network_Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd GameOfThrones_Network_Analysis
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the scripts to load character interaction data and construct the network.
2. Perform analysis to calculate centrality, closeness, and degree metrics.
3. Visualize the results to uncover insights about character interactions.

## Example Output

- **Network Graphs**: Visualize relationships and key characters.
- **Metrics Tables**: Display centrality, closeness, and degree values for each character.

## Data Source

Interaction data is derived from the *A Song of Ice and Fire* book series by George R.R. Martin.

## Goals

To provide a deeper understanding of the social dynamics and key players in *Game of Thrones* using advanced network analysis techniques.
